### *Hello, I am Weiguang Wu and also go by Felix. I am a 2nd-year Computer Science student at UC Irvine.*  
I am interested in computer science in general but have not discovered my focus yet. I am still in the journey of exploring. My interest of this subject mainly comes from my desire of creating something that will benefit people in their daily lives. Although it is a fairly broad goal for now, it is still my biggest motivation. I have done some projects for my coursework but not many outside of school. You will see more projects and contributions to projects in my profile in the future! I will work hard on improving myself!

If you are interested, here is my [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weiguang-wu-71b441232/). You can also shoot me an **email**(wwg12121@gmail.com). I am happy to connect with anyone and collaborate on projects :D
